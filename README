script/generate rspec_model BillRelation from_id:integer to_id:integer relation:string
Missing data model: related bills, actions, status
Bill subcommittee references often don't exist: e.g. Bill 106-s68 listed committee 'International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services' via <committee name="Senate Governmental Affairs" subcommittee="International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services" activity="Referral"/> which wasn't found
Constrain Roll#roll_type to not-blank (deal with: 103/rolls/h1994-68.xml)
BillType is dangerous in that you must call #to_s to get the expected view string
